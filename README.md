# BASEnvSync

![BASEnvSync](doc/bas.webp)

## About The Project

**TL;DR: Exports and imports SAP Business Application Studio environment settings**

If you're a developer working with **[SAP Business Application Studio ("BAS")](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/business-application-studio.html)**, chances are you are using its terminal a lot. Having worked with Linux, OS X and macOS for decades, I developed a habit of tweaking the terminal shell to my taste. Carefully crafted, heavily customized Bash prompts displaying Git branch status, execution times, autocomplete, command history, custom aliases, etc.

If all this resonates with you, then this VSCode extension might just be for you as well.

Many years ago, when working in multiple **SAP Business Application Studio** developer spaces simultaneously, I had quite the struggle to make sure all my spaces more or less had the same developer experience / look and feel. 

Not only terminal settings, but also global gitignore settings, git credentials, everything had to be set up again, which, as you probably have experienced yourself, was *extremely* time-consuming... Not to mention the "standard" BAS / VSCode settings, color scheme, keymaps, etc.

To mitigate that, I wrote a small shell script which allowed me to transfer these settings and configurations from one Dev Space to another, and in addition it transfered BAS' `settings.json`, `keymap.json` and an overview of any additional VSCode extensions you may have installed (see [this deprecated repo](https://github.com/qualiture/sync-bas-env)).

However, one day that script failed to work properly. It turned out, after an update of the underlying platform of BAS -- Eclipse Theia -- it no longer stored the `settings.json` file directly on the file system anymore. Instead, it is now stored somewhere inside the user profile, and I was not able to easily access it anymore.

**Luckily, BAS now lets you export / import your profile which contains all the user settings, *and* the installed extensions!**

Nevertheless, I still needed to find a way to tranfer other Dev Space settings, such as `.bashrc`, `.bash_aliases`, git settings, et al.

This VSCode extension lets you export your environment settings from one Dev Space, and lets you import those settings in another Dev Space.

## How It Works

 - First, you need to install the BASEnvSync VSCode extension.

 - After installation, you have two new options in the Command Palette:
     - Import BAS environment settings
     - Export BAS environment settings

The next part will outline how to export and import your profile and settings.


### 1) Exporting / importing BAS profile

Because this script **does not** export the BAS' `settings.json` file, you must export / import your BAS profile first:

**From the source Dev Space:**

- Click the "cogwheel" icon in the lower left, and select *Profiles* > *Export Profile...*
- Follow the steps to export your BAS profile, and save it to your local harddisk

**From the target Dev Space:**

- Drag the downloaded `<profile-name>.code-profile` file into the Explorer.
- Click the "cogwheel" icon in the lower left, and select *Profiles* > *Import Profile...*
- Follow the steps to import your BAS profile, and reload BAS

### 2) Exporting settings from source Dev Space

- Open the Command Palette, and execute **Export BAS environment settings**

- A file `bas-env.zip` will be created in the your `~/projects` directory.

    This ZIP file will contain -- if available in your Dev Space -- the following items:

    - `~/.bashrc`
    - `~/.bash_aliases`
    - `~/.profile`
    - `~/.npmrc`
    - `~/.gitignore`
    - `~/.gitconfig`
    - `~/.git-credentials`
    - `~/.scripts` (folder)

    > NB: In most cases, you will notice the `~/.scripts` folder is skipped; I created that folder containing some shell scripts to enhance Bash (history, autocomplete, etc)

- Download the `bas-env.zip` file to your local harddisk

### Importing settings to target Dev Space

- Drag the downloaded `bas-env.zip` file into the Explorer.

- Open the Command Palette, and execute **Import BAS environment settings**

- A file dialog opens which lkets you select the uploaded `bas-env.zip` file.

- After the settings have been loaded, open a new terminal and examine the applied changes.

## Roadmap

- Proper error handling
- Instead of a hard-coded list of files and folders to export, provide possibility of making this more flexible (config file? commandline arguments?)
