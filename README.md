## About The Project

**TL;DR: Exports and imports SAP Business Application Studio environment settings**

If you're a developer working with **[SAP Business Application Studio ("BAS")](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/business-application-studio.html)**, chances are you are using its terminal a lot. Having worked with Linux, OS X and macOS for decades, I developed a habit of tweaking the terminal shell to my taste. Carefully crafted, heavily customized Bash prompts displaying Git branch status, execution times, autocomplete, command history, custom aliases, etc:

> *Imagine recreating prompts like this manually every time you create a new Dev Space...*

If all this resonates with you, then this VSCode extension might just be for you as well.

Many years ago, when working in multiple **SAP Business Application Studio** developer spaces simultaneously, I had quite the struggle to make sure all my spaces more or less had the same developer experience / look and feel. 

Not only terminal settings, but also global gitignore settings, git credentials, everything had to be set up again, which, as you probably have experienced yourself, was *extremely* time-consuming... Not to mention the "standard" BAS / VSCode settings, color scheme, keymaps, etc.

To mitigate that, I wrote a small shell script which allowed me to transfer these settings and configurations from one Dev Space to another, and in addition it transfered BAS' `settings.json`, `keymap.json` and an overview of any additional VSCode extensions you may have installed (see [this deprecated repo](https://github.com/qualiture/sync-bas-env)).

However, one day that script failed to work properly. It turned out, after an update of the underlying platform of BAS -- Eclipse Theia -- it no longer stored the `settings.json` file directly on the file system anymore. Instead, it is now stored somewhere inside the user profile, and I was not able to easily access it anymore.

**Luckily, BAS now lets you export / import your profile which contains all the user settings, *and* the installed extensions!**

Nevertheless, I still needed to find a way to tranfer other Dev Space settings, such as `.bashrc`, `.bash_aliases`, git settings, et al.

This VSCode extension lets you export your environment settings from one Dev Space, and lets you import those settings in another Dev Space.

## How It Works

 - First, you need to install the BASEnvSync VSCode extension.

 - After installation, you have two new options in the BAS Command Palette:

    ![Commands](doc/commands.png)

 - Because the exporting of the BAS profile (see next part) includes all the installed extensions, *there is no need to reinstall the extension on the new Dev Space*! Simply run the import and off you go!

The next part will outline how to export and import your profile and settings.


### 1) Exporting / importing BAS profile

Because this script **does not** export the BAS' `settings.json` file, you must export / import your BAS profile first:

**From the source Dev Space:**

- Click the "cogwheel" icon in the lower left, and select *Profiles* > *Export Profile...*
- Follow the steps to export your BAS profile, and save it to your local harddisk.
  Just make sure the `BASEnvSync` extension is included in the profile export ðŸ˜Ž

**From the target Dev Space:**

- Drag the downloaded `<profile-name>.code-profile` file into the Explorer.
- Click the "cogwheel" icon in the lower left, and select *Profiles* > *Import Profile...*
- Follow the steps to import your BAS profile, and reload BAS

### 2) Exporting settings from source Dev Space

- Open the Command Palette, and execute **Export BAS environment settings**

- A file `bas-env.zip` will be created which you then download to your local harddisk.

    This ZIP file will contain -- if available in your Dev Space -- the following items:

    - `~/.bashrc`
    - `~/.bash_aliases`
    - `~/.profile`
    - `~/.npmrc`
    - `~/.gitignore`
    - `~/.gitconfig`
    - `~/.git-credentials`
    - `~/.inputrc`
    - `~/.scripts` (folder)

    > NB: In most cases, you will notice the `~/.scripts` folder is skipped; I created that folder containing some shell scripts to enhance Bash (history, autocomplete, etc)

### Importing settings to target Dev Space

- Open the Command Palette, and execute **Import BAS environment settings**

- After 1-2 seconds, a new tab will open which allows you to upload the `bas-env.zip` file (the file you have downloaded earlier) by clicking the **Select ZIP file to Upload** button:

    ![Commands](doc/upload_step1.png)

- When the initial upload of the `bas-env.zip` file was successful, click the **Transfer configuration to BAS** button:

    ![Commands](doc/upload_step2.png)

- After the settings have been loaded, open a new terminal and examine the applied changes.

## Roadmap

- Proper error handling
- Instead of a hard-coded list of files and folders to export, provide possibility of making this more flexible (config file? commandline arguments?)
